Philippians 2:5-11 (New International Version 1984)
5 Your attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus:
6 Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God
something to be grasped,
7 but made himself nothing, taking the very nature of a servant, being
made in human likeness.
8 And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself and
became obedient to deathâ€” even death on a cross!
9 Therefore God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the
name that is above every name,
10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on
earth and under the earth,
11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of
God the Father.
